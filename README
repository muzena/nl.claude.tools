# nl.claude.tools

Clojure tools by Claude. Contains

 * nl.claude.tools.dct: One dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform functions in clojure, including test data. Note: DCT is a prime candidate to be paralellized, and clojure is good at this. However this first version doesn't do anything parallel.

## Usage

Put the jar-file in your java extensions directory (on OSX for example /Library/Java/Extensions). Next just call

(use 'nl.claude.tools.dct)
(dct-ii [1 2 3 4 5])
(dct-iii [2 0 0 0])

These are one dimensional dct operations. dct is a synonym for dct-ii, idct is a synonym for dct-iii
